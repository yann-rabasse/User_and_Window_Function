In this challenge we‚Äôll create our first user-defined functions. Re-usable SQL script that can be used to keep our SQL queries clean and easy to read.

In this challenge we‚Äôll be using data from Greenweez, the organic e-commerce website:

Mail Campaigns
NPS (Net Promoter Score)

# Greenweez Mail

## 1.1) is_mail_be Function
The following query returns the different Greenweez mail campaigns:

```
SELECT
  ### Key ###
  journey_id
  ###########
  ,journey_name
  ,sent_nb
FROM `course17.gwz_mail_17`
ORDER BY
  sent_nb DESC
```

If the campaigns are sent to Belgian customers, the string in the journey_name column contains ‚Äúnlbe‚Äù.

**Our goal is to create a function that returns 1 if the mail campaign was sent to Belgium or 0 if it was sent somewhere else.**

Let‚Äôs break it down into a few steps:

1) Start by extending the query provided above. Create a new column: mail_be, which will equal to 1 if the mail campaign is sent to Belgium. Otherwise it will equal 0.

<details>
    <summary> <font color="red"><b>Answer</b></font></summary>

```
 SELECT
     ### Key ###
     journey_id
     ###########
     ,journey_name
     ,IF(journey_name LIKE "%_nlbe_%",1,0) AS mail_be
     ,sent_nb
 FROM `course17.gwz_mail_17`
 ORDER BY
     sent_nb DESC
```


</details>
    
2)Create a function is_mail_be in the course17 dataset that takes the journey_name as input and returns 1 if the mail campaign is sent to Belgium and 0 otherwise.

<details>
    <summary> <font color="red"><b>Answer</b></font></summary>

```
 CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION course17.is_mail_be(journey_name STRING) AS
     (IF(journey_name LIKE "%nlbe%",1,0))
```


</details>

3) Update your query from step one by using the new is_mail_be function to create the mail_be column. When creating columns remember to give them a useful name using an alias and the AS clause.

<details>
    <summary> <font color="red"><b>Answer</b></font></summary>

```
 SELECT
     ### Key ###
     journey_id
     ###########
     ,journey_name
     ,course17.is_mail_be(journey_name) AS mail_be
     ,sent_nb
 FROM `course17.gwz_mail_17`
 ORDER BY
     sent_nb DESC
```


</details>



## 1.2. mail_type Function
There are 3 different types of mail:

- newsletter - if the journey_name contains ‚Äúnl‚Äù or ‚Äúnlbe‚Äù.
- abandoned_basket - if the journey_name contains ‚Äúpanier_abandonne‚Äù (or ‚Äúabandoned_basket‚Äù in üá¨üáß)
- back_in_stock - if the journey_name contains ‚Äúback_in_stock‚Äù.

The data could be easier to analyse if this column is deconstructed into separate columns.

**Our goal is to create a function that classifies mail type based on journey_name**

1) Create a function called mail_type in the course17 dataset that contains one of the 3 above mentioned mail types depending on the journey_name.

<details>
    <summary> <font color="red"><b>Answer</b></font></summary>

``` 
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION `course17.mail_type`(journey_name STRING) AS (
 CASE
     WHEN journey_name LIKE "%panier_abandonne%" THEN "abandoned_basket"
     WHEN journey_name LIKE "%back_in_stock%" THEN "back_in_stock"
     WHEN journey_name LIKE "%nl%" THEN "newsletter"
     ELSE NULL
     END
 );
```


</details>

2)Select all the columns from the gwz_mail_17 table and add a mail_type column to the results by using the mail_type function you created.

<details>
    <summary> <font color="red"><b>Answer</b></font></summary>

```
SELECT
     ### Key ###
     journey_id
     ###########
     ,journey_name
     ,course17.is_mail_be(journey_name) AS mail_be
     ,course17.mail_type(journey_name) AS mail_type
     ,sent_nb
 FROM `course17.gwz_mail_17`
 ORDER BY
     sent_nb DESC
```

</details>

## 2. NPS and Deliveries


### 2.1. NPS Function

The following query returns the NPS scores (global_note) for different orders.

```
SELECT
    date_date
    ,orders_id
    ,transporter
    ,global_note
FROM `course17.gwz_nps_17`
A quick reminder of the NPS function:
```

NPS = % promoters - % detractors, where:
- Detractors give an overall score between 0 and 6
- Passives give an overall score between 7 and 8
- Promoters give an overall score between 9 and 10 üü¢

![01-Functions-asset-1-Untitled](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a44f9bf-52eb-49de-a1f6-3e49c65a57bf)


We can cleanly classify a customer as a detractor, passive, or promoter - a perfect place to use a function!

**Our goal is to create a function that returns -1 if the NPS (global_note) for an order is a detractor, 0 if the NPS is passive, or 1 if the NPS is a promoter.**

Like before, let‚Äôs break it down into steps:

    1) Extend the previous query by adding an nps column that equals to -1 if they are a detractor, 0 if they are passive, and 1 if the customer is a promoter.

<details>
    <summary> <font color="red"><b>Answer</b></font></summary>

```
 SELECT
     date_date
     ,orders_id
     ,transporter
     ,global_note
     ,CASE
     WHEN global_note IN (9,10) THEN 1
     WHEN global_note IN (7,8) THEN 0
     WHEN global_note BETWEEN 0 and 6 THEN -1
     ELSE NULL
     END AS nps
 FROM `course17.gwz_nps_17`
```


</details>

2) Create an nps function in the course17 dataset that takes global_note as an input and returns the same values as the nps column created in the step above.

[Create User defined function documentation](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/user-defined-functions)

<details>
    <summary> <font color="red"><b>Answer</b></font></summary>

```
 CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION `course17.nps`(global_note INT64) AS (
 CASE
     WHEN global_note IN (9,10) THEN 1
     WHEN global_note IN (7,8) THEN 0
     WHEN global_note BETWEEN 0 and 6 THEN -1
     ELSE NULL
     END
 );
```


</details>


3) Select all the columns from the gwz_nps_17 table and add an nps column to the results by using the nps function you created.

     ,transporter
     ,global_note
     ,course17.nps(global_note) AS nps
 FROM `course17.gwz_nps_17`
```


</details>


### 2.2. Transporter (carrier) Function

There are 2 different companies completing the deliveries:

- Chrono
- DPD

There are 2 kinds of delivery modes:

- Pickup point delivery
- Home delivery

We might be able to derive some insights between NPS and the logistics company or delivery mode.

**From the transporter column, create two new columns: one with of the delivery company, and one with the delivery mode.**

1) Create a transporter_brand function in the course17 dataset that takes the transporter column as an input and returns one of the 2 above-mentioned transporter brands.

<details>
    <summary> <font color="red"><b>Answer</b></font></summary>

```
 CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION `course17.transporter_brand`(transporter STRING) AS (
 CASE
     WHEN transporter LIKE "%Chrono%" THEN "Chrono"
     WHEN transporter LIKE "%DPD%" THEN "Dpd"
     ELSE NULL
     END
 );
```


</details>

2) Create a delivery_mode function in the course17 dataset that takes the transporter column as an input and returns one of the 2 above-mentioned delivery modes.

<details>
    <summary> <font color="red"><b>Answer</b></font></summary>

```
 CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION `course17.delivery_mode`(transporter STRING) AS (
 CASE
     WHEN transporter LIKE "%Pickup%" THEN "Pickup"
     WHEN transporter LIKE "%Home%" THEN "Home"
     ELSE NULL
     END
 );
```


</details>

3) Select all the columns from the gwz_nps_17 table and add the nps, delivery_mode, and transporter_brand columns to it using the new functions you created.
